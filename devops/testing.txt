Life cycle of Performance testing:
--------------------------------------
1. Requirements gathering
 
2. Planning/Design
 
3. Test execution
 
4. Result analysis
 
----------------------------------------
 
1. Requirements gathering. 
 
. what is the application we are going to test -
. how much user load need to be tested
. what is the functionality of the application. why it is bulit
. what is the technology used to build the application
. what is the server architecture
. Hardware details of application environment. 
 

what is the application we are going to test - e commerce application, ticket booking application, banking apploicaion, telceom application
 
how much user load need to be tested - 1000 users per hour, 10000 users per day. 
 
what is the functionality of the application. why it is bulit - basci user functionality
 
what is the technology used to build the application - Java, database ( Oracle/SQL ), what OS this is deployed
 
what is the server architecture - what type of app server is used ( web logic, web sphere etc), what type of web server (apache tomcat, glassfish ) is used
 
hardware details - app server, web server, db serever ( what amount of Memory each server is having installed ( 32 GB RAM ) webs erver ( 16 GB RAM ), DB server ( 100 GB RAM )
applicationserver ( 16 core cpu , processor) web server ( 8 core cpu ) DB server ( 32 core cpu ) 
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
2. Planning/Design
 
. how many no of tests will be executed
. what type of performanc metrics to be collected
. what is the timelines 
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Test execution 
 
. create test scenarios
. tester will execute all PT activities
. collect results of all tests
------------------------------------------------------
4. Reporting'
. create test reports
. analyse test reports
. find any performance issues.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

   co-relation
  

1. complete recording
2. check generate parent samples on all transactions
3. go to threadgroup
4. keep 1 user, 0 rampup, 1 loop count
5. add viewresultstree/aggregatereport to the threadgroup
6. replay script
7. go to viewresultstree and check request of login request and see if j2ee and j2ee is going with request.
8. go to response of login request - check for message "you have reached this page incorrectly"
9. go to 3rd login request -> go to its response and check welcome message is there or not
10. go to the login request from the script
11. copy the name 1 
12. go to replay resultsrtree
13. select 1st laucnh request and select responsedata tab and response body under responsedata
14. paste your usersessionname and click find -> you shouls see that search is failed.
15. go to next subsequent requests and search for usersession name until you find a result.
16.you should see usesession value is available in last "launch" request.
17. copy the user session line (ex:  <input type="hidden" name="userSession" value="132468.184285136ziVDiDcpccQVzzzHtAiicpQQDDHf"/>)
18. go to the text layout and select "Regularexpressiontester".
19. paste you copied line in Regularexpressiontester and should see a result in below
20. remove the only session value from the text line.
21. add (.*?) in the text line -> <input type="hidden" name="userSession" value="(.*?)"/>
22. click test button and you should see a results like " Match[1][1]=132468.184285136ziVDiDcpccQVzzzHtAiicpQQDDHf "
23. copy the successful expression
24. go to the last laucnh request from the script
25. right click on launch request -> add-> post processor-> RegularexpressExtractor
26. go to the regular expression text box and paste expression ( ex: "<input type="hidden" name="userSession" value="(.*?)"/>")
27. enter name of created variable as " TOKID"
28. Template as $1$
29. enter match no as 1
30. enter default value as TokID_NOTFOUND
31. go to the 1st login request
32. remove the user session value
33. and replace with ${TokID}
34. save your script
35. replay
36. chek the response of login requests from viewresultstree


think time:

1. go to every transaction and select first request withinn the transaction

2. right click on request

3. add-> timer->constant timer

4. mention your think time in milli seconds --------------------------------------------

add plugin manager to jmeter:

1. google - donwload jmeter plugin manager

2. got to the 1st link

3. clikc on install on webpage

4. click on pluginmanager.jar file - it will be downloaded

5. copy the pluginmanager.jar file to jmeter/lib/ext folder

6. restart jmeter

7. open jmeter -> open your script

8. clikc on options from jmeter main menu

9. you should see pluginmanager available at last

10.clikc on pluginmanager

11. go to available plugins tab

12. search for thread

13. select customthreadgroups option

14. click apply changes and restart button at bottom

15. then open jmeter again

16. open your script

17. right click on Testplan

18. add-> Threads -> J@pc Ultimate threadgroup

19. copy recording controller from regular threadgroup and paste on ultimate threadgroup.

20. then create your scenario

1. 3 basic graphs

- open plugin manager in jmeter

- go to available plugins

- select 3 basic graphs

- click apply changes restart

- open jmeter

-open script

- right click on threadgroup

- add-> listeners->jp@gc Active threads over time

- add-> listeners->jp@gc Response times over time

- start your test

- check if graphs are updating in run time

[12:49] Ravi (Guest)
2. Assertions 

- find out a valid resposne message from any request ( ex:login request will have a message like "user password is correct"

- then go to the request, right clikc on request, add->assertions->response assertions

- click on ADD button on response addertion

- paste your response message to the text box

- start test with wrong usename and password and check if script is failing

 3. Non Gui mode execution of jmeter

- create a scrpt with 1 user and hold load for 60 seconds and rampup is 0

- close jmeter

- open cmd

- go to the jmeter bin path and copy the path

- type "cd bin path" on cmd

- copy the jmx file path

- go to cmd and ( " jmeter -n -t pathofthescript\filename.jmx -l pathtotheresultfile\filename.csv " )

- you should see message on command window as "waiting for samples"

- you should see the results file created in the location with .csv extension 


4. Loop controller

- assume a scenario where you have to execute a test with 2 users, and run launch and logout once per user and login is 3 times per user

- select Login ransaction 

- right click on login transacton -> add -> logic controllers -> Loop controller

- copy your recording controller to Loop controller

- select loop controller and make loop count as 3

- keep thread settings as no of threads 3, hold load for 15 mins

- start your test

5 HTML report generation:

1. generate a raw result file by running a sample test
2. raw result file should be generated with .csv extension
3. create and empty folder for HTML results
4. open cmd
5. cd to jmeter bin folder
6. then execute below command
7. jmeter -g path_to_the .csv file -o path_to_the_emplty_folder
8. just run the command
9. you will see HTML file generated in empty folder.



how to create REST service script in jmeter.
------------------------------------------
1. open new jmeter window
2. right click on Testplan
3. add->threads->Threadgroup
4. right click on Threadgroup
5. add-> Logic controller->Transaction controller
6. right click on Transaction controller
7. add-> sampler-> Http Request
8. select http request from jmeter
9. copy server name to the request text box
10. change protocol to https
11. copy url to the path text box
12. check generate parant samples for all transaction controllers
14. add view results tree and aggregate report
15. run script with 1 user and check if request and response coming


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
16. build request for     http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/employee/1
17. right click on transaction controller and add->config element-> counter
18. make changes to the counter as in screen shot
19. use the varaiable name from counter in request url
20. run test with 2 users, chekc if counter is working or not.
